= Spring Couchbase cache support

This sample project demonstrates how to use caching with Couchbase. To run
this simple demo you need couchbase running on your machine with two buckets
named `default` and `public` and no password.

Of course, feel free to update the configuration to better suit your need.

This demo uses two caches:

* `foos` is created on-the-fly using the `default` bucket (i.e. the one that
was auto-configured by Spring Boot)
* `bars` is an explicit cache created via a `CacheManagerCustomizer` that
works with another bucket
